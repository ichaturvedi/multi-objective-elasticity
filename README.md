Multi-objective Elasticity for Spatio-temporal Data
===
This code implements the model discussed in the paper on modeling Skin Elasticity during Facial Expressions. It uses a spatio-temporal model to capture the movement of face muscles over time. Multi-objective optimisation is used to introduce constraints due to multiple facial actions simultaneously in a single emotion.
